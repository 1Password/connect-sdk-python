The 1Password Connect SDK provides access to 1Password via [1Password Connect](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect) hosted in your infrastructure. The library is intended to be used by Python applications to simplify accessing items in 1Password vaults.

## ‚ú® Quickstart

1. Install the 1Password Connect Python SDK:

   ```sh
   pip install onepasswordconnectsdk
   ```

2. Use the SDK:

   - Read a secret:

     ```python
     from onepasswordconnectsdk.client import (
         Client,
         new_client,
     }

     connect_client: Client = new_client(
         "{1Password_Connect_Host}",
         "{1Password_Connect_API_Token}"
     )

     client.get_item("{item_id}", "{vault_id}")
     ```

   - Write a secret:

     ```python
     from onepasswordconnectsdk.client import (
         Client,
         new_client,
     }

     connect_client: Client = new_client(
         "{1Password_Connect_Host}",
         "{1Password_Connect_API_Token}"
     )

     # Example item creation. Create an item with your desired arguments.
     item = Item(
         vault=ItemVault(id=op_vault),
         id="custom_id",
         title="newtitle",
         category="LOGIN",
         tags=["1password-connect"],
         fields=[Field(value="new_user", purpose="USERNAME")],
     )
     new_item = op_client.create_item(op_vault, item)
     ```
